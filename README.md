    How do I approach designing software?
    
       I feel that the best way to work on any project is to divide the requirements into smaller chunks that can then be worked on individually. 
       This also helps to ensure that requiremetns are being met at every level and that each component will work correctly when everything is fully integrated.

    How do I approach developing programs?
        
        Iteration is key to working on a project like the one I worked on for this class because not only does it allow me to get a viable idea of concepts, 
        but it also allows for errors to be worked on before they become more severe issues. 

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        
        Since I'm not going into the field of computer graphics, I can say that this class did help me to "visually" see progress in a manner that is not common
        with other projects or programs. By that I mean, it's very easy to see if the output is leading in the right direction when you are able to see the 3D object
        come to life with the correct application of code. As for computer science helping me reach my goals, I can say that it is central to helping me reach my
        goals because I am aiming to switch careers in the near future and the skills I have gained throughout my bachelor's program will help me reach my true 
        potential and be able to work in a new environment.
